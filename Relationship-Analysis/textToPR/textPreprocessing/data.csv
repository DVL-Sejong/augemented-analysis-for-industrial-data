"Nice set keyboard and mouse, have since purchased a wireless mouse from them as well as a specific 1/3 size 1 hand keyboard for gaming. I keep the keyboard connected but the mouse has been replaced by their better wireless version as I found the mouse to be lacking and not very ergonomic.",0,0,0,1
Very lightweight.  Keys snap right back up after pressing.  Keeps up with my speed of typing which is very fast without any issues.  Like the lights at night time even better.,1,0,0,1

"Just got it today. Haven' plugged it in. However. I bought the previous version 5 years ago, and it just recently started acting up.

"Overall Rating; 8.8/10Pros:F1-F12 are primary, not functions of FN feature.Backlight has multiple options and works behind the letters - not around the keys - making it easy to see letters night or day.Good layout, and semi-ergo.Cons:Bulky space key, giving an old school keyboard feel - a pro to some, a con for me.No ""Off"" or ""Power Down"" button, for instant or easy power access. Not a huge deal though, just a useful feature on some keyboards.",0,0,0,1

"For under $40, this is a nice keyboard / mouse set.I had some odd quirky problems initially when I plugged in the mouse and keyboard, but after restarting and removing and plugging the devices back into the USB ports they worked fine.The keyboard LED lighting is changeable by using the FN key and selecting Insert / Home / Delete / Pg Up / Pg Down / End.The keyboard also includes a series of built in FN + Fx (x=1-12) short cuts that use the Windows default setting for the various applications (media controls, search, home, email, and my computer).The mouse button assignments and pre-assigned and the mouse speed is adjustable with one of the buttons on the mouse (4 DPI settings).There is no software for the keyboard or mouse to alter the functionality that is built into the keyboard or mouse.  Also no apparent way of assigning LED key colors like on a higher end solution like a Razor keyboard.",1,0,0,1
